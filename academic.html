        <h5>Introduction:</h5>
        <p> All in all, I wrote around a dozen academic papers throughout my college career. However, I've compiled just four
            of them to display here. I chose some of them because the topics intrigued me and I had a lot of fun writing
            them, others I chose because I labored long hours to write them and I am proud of the result. Each is different,
            written to fulfill unique set of criteria, and formatted accordingly.

                <h4>Faith, Ethics, and Absurdity:</h4>
                <h5>A Study of Kierkegaard and “Faith by Virtue of the Absurd”</h5>
                <p>One of the most fascinating philosophers in the 1800’s was Soren Kierkegaard. His philosophy differed greatly
                    from the mainstream philosophy of his time. He is known by many as the father of existentialism. In this
                    paper I will detail many of Kierkegaard’s ideas by explaining what a “teleological suspension of the
                    ethical” and “faith by virtue of the absurd” mean, along with discussing how the story of Abraham and
                    Isaac supports Kierkegaard’s ideas, and what my opinion is concerning the matter. </p>
                <p>Kierkegaard famously said, “truth is subjectivity.” This sounds alarming at first, because if truth is merely
                    subjective, then anyone can get away with doing what they “believe” because it’s true. Except that’s
                    not what Kierkegaard means when he says “truth is subjectivity.” He means that finding objective truth
                    still involves a choosing, that an attitude towards a belief is just as important as the belief itself.
                    It’s how one follows an objective truth that matters. </p>
                <p>This philosophy was novel in its time. However, now we can read about many philosophies detailing similar
                    ideas. This sect of philosophy is called Existentialism. Since Kierkagaard’s ideas were some of the first
                    he is often considered to be “The Father of Existentialism.” Existentialism has come to mean “any philosophy
                    that asserts the most fundamental questions involve meaning and choice.” These themes differ greatly
                    from the majority of philosophies, and deals with the individual’s quest for truth rather than truth
                    itself.
                </p>
                <p>Kierkegaard describes three distinctly different lives a person can lead. The detailing of these three lives
                    certainly formulate an existentialist argument, of which Kierkegaard has become famous for. The three
                    types of lives are the aesthetic life, the ethical life, and the religious life.</p>
                <p>The aesthetic life is one of personal gratification. It is often described as an “immersion in sensuous experience;
                    valorization of possibility over actuality; egotism; fragmentation of subject of experience; nihilistic
                    wielding of irony and skepticism; and flight from boredom.” Sounds great doesn’t it? Kierkegaard doesn’t
                    think so. Instead he says this type of life is inauthentic and not free. In a way the aesthetic life
                    lets you lead a life of luxury, but after a while you don’t govern your own choices. Instead, addictions
                    and worldly illusions dictated your actions. </p>
                <p>The second life is called the ethical life. It differs from the aesthetic life in many ways except for one.
                    It’s still inauthentic and not free. In an ethical life a person will conform to a certain moral code.
                    In many ways they will adopt “the universal” or “prevailing social norms” of the time. Merely adopting
                    a moral code doesn’t liberate someone because they are still a part of “the crowd.” They will not make
                    choices that are vital to their salvation based on the fact that they are restrained by societies code.
                </p>
                <p>The religious life, however, is the only authentic and free life. It’s the best life, yet it is full of anxiety,
                    despair, angst, and forlornness. Not many people make it to a religious life. The religious life demands
                    a “terrible responsibility” of individuals, which causes much anxiety, “for upon h/er existential choices
                    hangs h/er eternal salvation or damnation.” Another key point Kierkegaard points out about the religious
                    life is that, “If we choose faith we must suspend our reason in order to believe in something higher
                    than reason. In fact we must believe by virtue of the absurd.” </p>
                <p>Virtue of the absurd is a notion that God will demand certain things from his children that defy logic. Only
                    after one lets go of logic and has faith will they be enabled to live a religious life. Job, in the Bible,
                    “gets everything back again by virtue of the absurd,” and Kierkegaard himself “hoped to get Regine back
                    again after breaking off their engagement, by virtue of the absurd.” Like “faith by virtue of the absurd,”
                    a “teleological suspension of the ethical” will require people to forsake logic by demanding moral people
                    to do seemingly immoral things in the name of faith. </p>
                <p>In the Bible, the story of Abraham and Isaac illustrates both “faith by virtue of the absurd” and a “teleological
                    suspension of the ethical.” In the book of Genesis, Chapter 22, it states, “God did tempt Abraham, and
                    said unto him, Abraham... Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and... offer him
                    there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.” It’s interesting to
                    note that the Hebrew word for “tempt” is “test” or “prove.” In many ways God was testing Abraham. God
                    asks Abraham to do the absurd and to sacrifice his own son. To any moral person this would be considered
                    murder, which is frowned upon greatly. </p>
                <p>So what does Abraham do? If he was living an aesthetic life, he would ignore God, return and rebuild Sodom
                    and Gomorrah, and dwell there for the rest of his life. If he was living an ethical life, he would scoff
                    at the idea of “murder,” and stick to his society’s moral code. If he was living a religious life, he
                    would follow God by virtue of the absurd, and do what God commanded, even if it seemed like God had commanded
                    something seemingly unethical. Abraham demonstrates his faith to God by taking Isaac up to the mountain
                    to sacrifice him. </p>
                <p>Kierkegaard stated that “the story of Abraham contains a teleological suspension of the ethical.” Meaning
                    the God who said, “Thou shalt not kill.” is the same God who commanded Abraham to sacrifice his own son.
                    It would seem like God operates on a higher law than his previously revealed set of ethics. If Abraham
                    were to follow God’s command to kill Isaac, would he be acting immorally? This brings into question God’s
                    ethics. Kierkegaard says in regard to God’s law and worldly ethics, “For the genuinely religious person
                    there is a higher and quite different source and form of obligation.” Abraham trusts religiously in God,
                    ignoring ethics as he knew them, and listens to God by sacrificing his son. </p>
                <p>In the Bible there doesn’t seem to be much anxiety on the part of Abraham. But if we are to impose natural
                    human emotion into the story, one can imagine a distraught Abraham going to sacrifice his son. His only
                    son. He is definitely living the religious life, which causes him despair and anxiety and forlornness,
                    like Kierkegaard mentioned anyone to live the religious life would experience. However, Abraham is rewarded
                    greatly for his faith. He doesn’t have to kill his son after all, and is promised that “all the nations
                    of the earth” will be blessed because of his obedience. </p>
                <p>Ultimately, by using this story, Kierkegaard wants to illustrate that to have true faith in God, a person
                    must give up logic. Was it logical for Abraham to sacrifice his son? Certainly not. Did Abraham have
                    faith in God? Without a doubt. Abraham was free from the restrictions of both the aesthetic and ethical
                    lifestyle, and dedicated to a higher law through faith. Kierkegaard’s argument in providing this story
                    is that faith will always require you to do illogical things, even if they aren’t as drastic as in the
                    case of Abraham. Kierkegaard says that Christianity “embodies paradoxes which are offensive to reason.”
                    He uses the example of an eternal God becoming the finite form of Jesus. The only way to truly embrace
                    this belief is by virtue of the absurd. </p>
                <p>I, personally, agree with Kierkegaard. I have beliefs that I’d rather not try and prove logically, but that
                    I’ve felt are true. These sort of beliefs must be approached with the right attitude or they will not
                    do me any good. Any person who adopts such beliefs would have to be religious about them, or they suddenly
                    become just a set of restrictions that govern their lives. On the other hand, if a person is to abandon
                    their set of ethics all together, they don’t have much choice than to lead the aesthetic lifestyle, which
                    isn’t any better than the ethical. So whatever the belief, a person must be religious about it in the
                    quest for truth. It’s the only way to live a free life. </p>
                <p>However, “Faith by virtue of the absurd” does present some major issues, because throughout history people
                    have done wild things in the name of God, and Kierkegaard seems to be justifying them to some degree.
                    His argument could give way for radicals of all religions, but I don’t think this is what he intends
                    to happen. Kierkegaard’s example of Abraham and Isaac is just an extreme example of “faith by virtue
                    of the absurd” and a “teleological suspension of the ethical.” Ultimately, his argument encourages people
                    to live religiously, and to own their choices and lives. Kierkegaard promotes a life of passion and fulfillment
                    in the lives of the individual, which I think is worth the risk of a few radicals. Amen, I say unto Kierkegaard’s
                    argument, amen.</p>

                <h4>To Kill a Mockingbird</h4>
                <h5>Should It Still Be Studied In School?</h5>
                <p>Harper Lee’s book, To Kill a Mockingbird, is often hailed as the greatest book of this century. It was released
                    on July 11, 1960, where it found a spot atop the bestseller list. The book comfortably remained on the
                    list for 80 weeks following its release, and is celebrated today as, “one of the 10 bestselling novels
                    of all time.” (Who Was Atticus Finch?). To Kill a Mockingbird has had a rich history in the world of
                    literature, which is quite a contrast to the ugly, American history that it portrays in its text. Because
                    statistics attest that the book has captivated thousands of readers, the question we ask ourselves now
                    isn’t whether To Kill a Mockingbird is a good story, rather is it a valuable text? By examining the book
                    through the lens of a historical critic, and exploring the sociological events that Harper Lee experienced
                    in her life, I aim to prove that To Kill a Mockingbird, is indeed valuable, despite its narrator’s narrow
                    lens and critical claims that the book is pure “sentiment.” To Kill a Mockingbird, not only portrays
                    a concentrated portion of a larger history, but also manages to teach lessons learned throughout history,
                    making it a valuable text worth studying in school. </p>
                <p>Texts of all kinds can be critiqued using an array of different critical theories. In a chapter, which details
                    historical criticism, we learn, “Formalist criticism in its purest form, for example, assumes that everything
                    relevant to a discussion of a particular literary text may be found in or deduced from that text. Historical
                    criticism assumes the opposite: the text itself is insufficient to explain the text.” Therefore, a historical
                    critic must look outside the text to find its true value. They must look at history. To Kill a Mockingbird
                    (herein referred to as Mockingbird), as a literary text, details and discusses many historical issues
                    that were prevalent in the early 1930’s, such as racism, gender discrimination, and the struggles of
                    social class. However, in order to truly gauge if Mockingbird is valuable, one must not only examine
                    the events that occur in the book, but ultimately compare them with events that actually occurred. In
                    other words, are the events that happen in the book true to the nature of history? A reader wouldn’t
                    be surprised to discover that Harper Lee herself witnessed events similar to those that were depicted
                    in her book, which adds value to the book’s narration, making it not only a historical text, but a fictional
                    representation of history itself.</p>
                <p>Maycomb county, for example, is almost identical to Monroeville, Alabama, the city where Harper Lee was born
                    and raised. The honorable lawyer, Atticus Finch, was greatly inspired by Harper’s own father, Amasa Lee.
                    Even the book’s narrator, Jean Louise “Scout” Finch, is considered to be a representation of Harper Lee.
                    Whether the reader is aware of it or not, Mockingbird is as valuable as the history it represents. </p>
                <p>However, some critics fail to consider the historical events that Harper Lee experienced during her life
                    and hastily conclude that Mockingbird isn’t valuable. In a critique of the book Harold Bloom says, “The
                    crisis of (Scout’s) book confirm her in her intrinsic strength and goodness, without wounding her sensibility
                    or modifying her view of reality.” It would seem like Harold Bloom wanted to see Scout struggle, deeply
                    and personally, in Mockingbird. Instead, Scout views societies conflict from a far and enjoys her childhood,
                    occasionally learning a lesson or two along the way. In his article, Just How Good Is ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’?,
                    William Giraldi mentions that unlike other books with heavy racial themes, Mockingbird is unusually “sentimental.”
                    He essentially agrees with Harold. Their question: how can a book, which clearly wishes to instill change
                    in its audience, possibly demand change from its readers when the book’s main characters don’t experience
                    a drastic change themselves?</p>
                <p> Perhaps, the change doesn’t need to be drastic in order to be significant. History might provide the answer.
                    What sort of challenges did the young Harper Lee face? In Who Was Atticus Finch?, an article written
                    by Talmage Boston, he states, “Like Scout, the author enjoyed the company of a peculiar summertime friend,
                    and was intrigued by a young man on her street mysteriously imprisoned in his own home . . . Writing
                    a book 20 years after her childhood, she described what she had seen, felt, and remembered in her . .
                    . hometown.” In other words, readers are experiencing history as Harper experienced it, whether it be
                    what they see or feel while they are reading. She, like Scout, was curious, and enjoyed running around
                    Monroe in the summer with the boys. The ultimate reality is Harper Lee may not have been personally affected
                    by society’s faults in her childhood, and if she wasn’t, then why should Scout?</p>
                <p>A similar truth is embedded in the pages of Mockingbird. Some people were happy in the early 1900’s, despite
                    racial slurs and other forms of social discrimination. That’s the truth. Kids were innocent. Did the
                    end of the book depict a crippled Scout, haunted and torn by a harsh society? No. She was still a kid.
                    She was still making sense of everything. The book is “sentimental” because we experience the story through
                    the eyes of a child. In a way, this is the perfect way to tell a story such as this, because a child
                    doesn’t understand injustice. After learning about Hitler in school Scout asks Jem about Miss Gates hypocrisy,
                    “How can you hate Hitler so bad an’ then turn around and be ugly about folks right at home?” Seeing a
                    girl trying to come to grips with living in an imperfect society, and still remain happy, is beautiful.
                    It’s beautiful, and it happened, which means we can do it too.</p>
                <p>Even if we were to entertain Harold’s critique of Mockingbird, and assume Scout didn’t struggle personally,
                    it wouldn’t hold true. Scout does struggle, just not in the way critics might want her to. At school
                    Scout gets taunted by Cecil Jacobs because Atticus is defending Tom Robinson, a local African American.
                    She knows she shouldn’t fight him, but wants to defend her father, so she fights him anyway. She recalls,
                    “I was far too old and too big for such childish things, and the sooner I learned to hold in, the better
                    off everyone would be. I soon forgot. Cecil Jacobs made me forget.” Considering how young Scout is, she
                    handles her emotions fairly well. However, it’s easy to make mistakes when we are young. The next day
                    Scout returns to school, and for the first time in her life steps down from a fight. That’s personal
                    growth! Scout not beating the little twerp a second time is only one example from a whole school of lessons
                    she learned throughout the book, which implies Scout is fluid in her beliefs, and absorbs truth easily.
                    Sadly, there comes a time in almost everybody’s life when their beliefs become concrete, even when they
                    have much to learn. That’s when innocence dies. That’s the difference between the common white male in
                    Mockingbird, and Scout. </p>
                <p>The same can be said about Harper’s life, or anybody’s life for that matter. We do not wake up one day to
                    some drastic experience that changes our lives forever, rather we experience little changes each day.
                    The sum of those little changes can prove to be most valuable, especially if we remain innocent and constantly
                    allow our beliefs to change. The fact that Harper Lee wrote a book based on her life is evidence that
                    she experienced a gradual change. Two lessons we can learn from Harper’s history is that change occurs
                    slowly, and when we become concrete in our beliefs we hurt not only our personal well-being, but society’s
                    welfare too. Those lessons are presented to us throughout both history and Mockingbird, which makes it
                    a valuable text. </p>
                <p>Referring back to the article, Just How Good Is ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’?, William Giraldi further illustrates
                    his point when he compares Harper Lee’s book to Mark Twain’s, Huckleberry Finn. He states, “Huckleberry
                    Finn isn’t feel-good because it demands action of us: It petitions us for sacrifice, and the typical
                    American would rather not consider that.” He continues by saying the opposite of Mockingbird: it doesn’t
                    demand sacrifice of us, which is why Americans cling to it. By saying that the book doesn’t challenge
                    our moral character, William inherently implies the book doesn’t hold any real value. William mockingly
                    states, “As long as there are Atticuses in the world, all will be well, and you yourself can remain recumbent.”
                </p>
                <p>If our cynical friend, William, were to step away from fiction and examine the reality behind Mockingbird,
                    he might change his mind about it. Does Mockingbird petition us to sacrifcice? Surely, it does. Only
                    not in the same way Huckleberry Finn does. The reason so many people cherish Mockingbird is because it
                    challenges readers to change in a personal way. In Huckleberry Finn, Huck risks his life to save Jim,
                    a slave that has escaped. Despite such a noble cause, most people aren’t going to lay down their lives,
                    especially when it comes to changing political norms, because politics don’t change overnight, even with
                    a martyrdom. If anyone knows how to handle politics, it would be Atticus Finch. After all, he is a lawyer.
                    After Scout gets in a fight at school Atticus teaches her a valuable principle. He says, “You just hold
                    your head high and keep those fists down. No matter what anybody says to you, don’t you let ‘em get your
                    goat. Try fighting with your head for a change.” His philosophy is not to fight harder, but to fight
                    smarter. Atticus knows that the best way to change law would be to set an example, encourage others to
                    be better, and combat the roots of racism where it counts, which would be to challenge society’s moral
                    compass in a reasonable manner. Atticus’s strategy in combatting discrimination may feel strange at times,
                    but it makes sense if you consider the historical figure that inspired Atticus’s character. </p>
                <p>Under the mask of Atticus Finch lies Amasa Lee, Harper’s own father. Amasa led a similar life to his fictional
                    counterpart, Atticus Finch. Both of them were single parents, were lawyers in Alabama, and courageously
                    stared down racial threats. </p>
                <p>Amasa Lee, as editor and publisher of the Monroe Journal, followed the case of Walter Lett, an African-American
                    convicted of rape. In many ways Walter’s case resembled that of Tom Robinson’s in Mockingbird. Like Tom
                    Robinson, Walter was also sentenced to death. The Alabama Board of Pardons later changed his sentence
                    to life in prison after a campaign “led by Amasa Lee” wrote letters stating they “felt the evidence had
                    not established the defendant’s guilt.” This is a great example of a simple act that yielded small, but
                    significant results. The campaign surely sparked a worthwhile conversation in Monroe, from which they
                    were able to mold a better society.</p>
                <p>Reminiscent of Amasa’s campaign is Atticus’s experience in the courthouse defending Tom. Like Amasa Lee,
                    Atticus Finch knew his audience. He knew winning the case wasn’t about defending Tom, but about challenging
                    the white juries prejudice. His final words in the court were, “Gentlemen, a court is no better than
                    each man of you sitting before me on this jury. A court is only as sound as its jury, and a jury is only
                    as sound as the men who make it up. I am confident that you gentlemen will review without passion the
                    evidence you have heard, come to a decision, and restore this defendant to his family. In the name of
                    God, do your duty.” His words weren’t defending Tom. They were convicting the jury. He was fighting smarter.
                    Despite losing the trial, a little progress was made. In the words of Miss Maudie Maycomb County was,
                    with the help of Atticus, making a “baby-step” toward a better society.</p>
                <p> If there is one thing that Harper’s history, as experienced outside the text of Mockingbird, can offer, it
                    is that the small things in life matter. Mockingbird might not petition readers to act drastically, like
                    critics may demand of other books, but it petitions readers in other valuable ways. It makes the reader
                    feel as if happiness can be found in perilous times, if one is to remain innocent. Scout, a historical
                    representation of Harper Lee, demonstrates innocence by constantly learning throughout Mockingbird. History
                    teaches us that we can be tolerant of other’s beliefs, while still instigating a moral change in their
                    character, but one must learn to live comfortably with themselves first. This is reinforced by Amasa,
                    who wrote letters petitioning Walter’s false conviction, and Atticus, who lived honorably, and challenged
                    the jury in defense of Tom Robinson. Each yielding small, but significant results. History supports the
                    value of these lessons, and they have proven worthwhile in the life of those that have been influenced
                    by either Harper and Amasa Lee, or Scout and Atticus Finch. </p>
                <p>Mockingbird is based heavily on the life of Harper Lee, who experienced history in a very unique way. It
                    is valuable to readers from a historical perspective because it not only teaches a portion of valuable
                    history, but also allows history to reinforce valuable lessons taught in Mockingbird, which challenge
                    readers to grow personally.</p>

                <h4>When Superheroes Fall:</h4>
                <h5>
                    The Effects of Disconfirming Communication, the Exit Response, and Lack of Self-Disclosure in Captain America: Civil War
                </h5>
                <p>What would you get if Stan Lee, the man behind Marvel Comics, and an interpersonal scholar decided to make
                    a movie? You would get something like Captain America: Civil War (hereafter referred to as Civil War),
                    which combines aspects of realistic interpersonal communication with those not-so-realistic aspects typical
                    of the super hero genre: intense sequences of fighting involving the use unnatural superpowers set in
                    a climate of heightened global conflict. Once a viewer can see past the action and spectacle of Civil
                    War, it is about friends trying to work through differences. Essentially, the movie is about the main
                    characters, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, trying to work through their differences, but both feel strongly
                    that they are right. In this essay I intend to, first, provide a synopsis of the Civil War, then demonstrate
                    how the use of disconfirming communication (evaluation and certainty), instead of confirming communication
                    (provisionalism), and a lack of self-disclosure between characters, leads to exit frequent exit responses
                    that further perpetuates conflict. Finally, I will offer advice directed mostly at Roger, which will
                    help him quickly resolve an issue, without so much fighting, should he find themselves in a similar circumstance
                    in the future. </p>
                <p>Civil War follows the events of Captain America: Winter Soldier (hereafter referred to as Winter Soldier)
                    and Avengers: Age of Ultron (hereafter referred to as Age of Ultron). In order to understand why Steve
                    Rogers (AKA Captain America) and Tony Stark (AKA Iron Man) act the way they do in Civil War, one must
                    understand what they experienced in their past. In Winter Soldier, Rogers finds himself caught up in
                    a web of lies and conspiracy, when he learns that SHIELD, an organization he once trusted, has secretly
                    been infiltrated by Hydra, an evil and powerful organization that seeks world domination. Rogers, who
                    eventually takes down Hydra and foils their attempt at world domination, is now hesitant to trust organizations
                    that may have hidden agendas, including his very own government. A few months later, Tony Stark proposes
                    an idea, Project Ultron, that may assist the Avengers, a group of superheroes dedicated to saving humanity,
                    if they need it in the future. Tony’s idea is to use technology and the power of an infinity stone, which
                    contains intelligence inside it, to create an advanced robotic task force that can help ease the burden
                    of the Avengers. Even after Rogers, a fellow member of the Avengers, advised Stark not to mess with the
                    power of the infinity stone, Stark proceeds with his project. Shortly after Ultron, the highly intelligent
                    robot, is created, it learns of the terrible things humans have done and decides to destroy humanity
                    entirely. Stark, Rogers, and other superheroes eventually put an end to Ultron, but not before many innocent
                    civilians were killed in the destruction caused by their intense battle with Ultron. </p>
                <p>Because of this destruction and death caused in Age of Ultron, the United Nations is pressured by Earth’s
                    citizens to control the Avengers in Civil War. The government proposes the Sokovia Accords, a superhero
                    registration system through which the government would dictate what the Avengers can and cannot do, almost
                    as if they were weapons of mass destruction. Feeling the need to be put in check after causing so much
                    devastation with Ultron, Stark is an advocate for the Sokovia Accords. Rogers, however, refuses to sign
                    them and give up his freedom, knowing full well that there may be a sinister motive behind the accords.
                    Their differences regarding this issue drives the conflict throughout the movie. </p>
                <p>Neither Stark nor Rogers hesitate to assert, with certainty, that their point of view is one hundred percent
                    correct, which is a from disconfirming language discussed in (Wood, 2014). Referred to as certainty,
                    it is the opposite of provisionalism, or the willingness to compromise. “We communicate certainty by
                    using language that is absolute and often dogmatic. This kind of language suggests that there is one
                    and only on answer, valid point of view, or reasonable course of action” (Wood, 2014, p. 231). To illustrate
                    their use of disconfirming language, I will use quotes from a few scenes in the movie. </p>
                <p>After the Sokovia Accords are proposed, the Avengers meet to discuss their plan of action, but Stark doesn’t
                    want to hear the opinions of others. “There’s no decision-making process here,” he states. “We need to
                    be put in check, whatever form that take, I’m game. If we can’t accept limitation, then we are no better
                    than the bad guys.” After Stark communicates his ideas with such certainty, Rogers can react in one of
                    two ways. He can either defend his own opinions or he can stay quiet. Of course, Rogers responds to the
                    conflict with certainty of his own, voicing his opinion. “Tony, if we sign this, we surrender our right
                    to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don’t think we should go? What if there’s somewhere
                    we need to go and they don’t let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own,”
                    he says. Both heroes believe with certainty that they are doing the right thing, and by doing so, disqualify
                    the opinion of the other. This is a clear example of certainty as a form of disconfirming communication.
                </p>
                <p>Despite their use of disconfirming language, I argue that during the first part of the movie they are attempting
                    to maintain their relationship by working towards a solution, which (Wood, 2014) refers to as the voice
                    response to conflict. The voice response to conflict is the healthiest and most constructive of the four
                    responses to conflict discussed in (Wood, 2014). The voice response is described as a means to directly
                    address and resolve conflict. “Voice implies that people care enough about a relationship to notice when
                    something is wrong and do something to improve the situation” (Wood, 2014, p. 261-62) Rogers and Stark
                    are using their voice to try and figure out a solution, but the original conversation is cut short when
                    Rogers receives a text that a dear friend has passed away. Though his accuse for exiting is valid, Rogers
                    still responds by physically leaving the conflict. Later, Stark and Rogers try again to work actively
                    toward a solution, responding to conflict with voice once more. However, after using more disconfirming
                    communication, the only way for Rogers to respond to the conflict is to exit. </p>
                <p>“Sometimes, I want to punch you in your perfect teeth, but I don’t want to see you gone,” Stark says as he
                    tries to convince Rogers to sign the Sokovia Accords for the second time. “We need you Cap. So far nothing
                    has happened that can’t be undone. Just sign.” In this situation, which takes place a day or so after
                    Rogers initially walks away from the conflict, it is interesting to note that a small incident of self-disclosure
                    on Stark’s part is immediately followed by confirming communication from Rogers. (Wood, 2014) describes
                    self-disclosure as “the intentional revelation of personal information about ourselves that others are
                    unlikely to discover in other ways” (p. 222). Studies have shown that “as a relationship develops further,
                    the breadth and depth of self-disclosure grows. When a relationship deteriorates, levels of self-disclosure
                    usually decrease again” (Utz, 2015). Not only does Stark disclose why he wants Rogers to sign, but also
                    discloses why he, personally, signed. “I’m not saying it’s impossible, but there would have to be safeguards,”
                    Rogers admits, and briefly shows signs of provisionalism, the willingness to compromise for the sake
                    of the relationship. However, he immediately takes back his gesture when he learns Tony has already detained
                    Wanda, a fellow Avenger, because she, like Rogers, didn’t sign the accords. He immediately gets mad,
                    as any chance of him signing the accords is thrown out the window. “Give me a break! I’m doing what has
                    to be done to stave off something worse,” Tony yells. “You keep telling yourself that,” Rogers says before
                    leaving the room. Here, Rogers demonstrates the exit response once more, which proves to be harmful to
                    their relationship this time around. It is important to note, however, that although Rogers and Stark
                    try and respond with voice, and actively seek solutions, Rogers always exits. In this scenario, it may
                    seem like the correct thing to do, as both are set in their ways and avoiding the conflict will spare
                    them time and energy. However, (Wood, 2014) states, “Because exit doesn’t address problems, it tends
                    to be destructive” (p. 260). This statement holds true, as the next time Rogers and Stark see each other
                    at an empty airport, they end up physically fighting, which further destroys their relationship.</p>
                <p>However, right before their showdown at the airport, Rogers and Stark talk briefly. During those few moments
                    of dialogue they could have solved the issue peaceably, but don’t because, once again, they use disconfirming
                    communication tactics. “You are after the wrong guy,” says Rogers. Not only is Rogers demonstrating certainty
                    again, but also evaluation, which is another form of disconfirming communication. Evaluation is a way
                    of judging the other person (Wood, 2014). Notice Rogers doesn’t try and persuade Stark that he is after
                    the wrong guy, but tells him that he is. There are a lot of implications in evaluations that cause the
                    receiver of them to become defensive. Stark uses similar disconfirming communication. “Your judgement
                    is askew,” he tells Rogers, implying that Rogers is crazy. Notice how they aren’t even discussing the
                    problem anymore. They are just calling each other out. According to (Rusbult, Zembrodt & Gunn, 1982),
                    “refusing to discuss problems, criticizing the [other] for things unrelated to the real problem,” and
                    “treating the [other] badly emotionally or physically,” are signs of a neglectful response to conflict
                    (p. 1231). I argue that, in Civil War, fighting can be categorized similarly. They’re done with talking
                    and they couldn’t care about the status of their relationship at this point. They are just trying to
                    prove their point. This response makes sense, considering (Beatty & Dobos, 1993) suggest, “Disconfirming
                    treatment inhibits one's sense of ‘interconnectedness’ with others, and encourages interpersonal disconnectedness.
                    This detachment leads to insensitivity, a condition underlying the undesirable hyper masculine behaviors”
                    (p. 188). It is no surprise then, that two highly masculine friends fight to resolve a conflict when
                    their disconfirming communication methods aren’t enough to solve the problem. </p>
                <p>Ultimately, the final fight between Stark and Rogers could have been avoided altogether. So, I offer my advice
                    to both Stark and Rogers, though I aim it mostly at Rogers because, if he had self-disclosed valuable
                    information, he could have prevented the final standoff with Stark from ever happening. By sharing, early
                    on, what knowledge he had, and by expressing his motivation for doing what he was doing, he could’ve
                    saved a lot of time and energy. Eventually, Rogers realizes this himself, and he writes to Tony at the
                    end of the movie, saying, </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “I’m sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you were only doing
                    what you believe in, and that’s all any of us can do, it’s all any of us should. So, no matter what,
                    I promise if you — if you need us. If you need me, I’ll be there.”
                </blockquote>
                <p>This is an act of self disclosure, which means the relationship might rekindle and trust might be regained.
                    However, they may have already taken this too far. The damage may be unrepairable. This is my advice:
                    Firstly, self-disclose before the conflict gets to be too much, instead of as a way to try and repair
                    the damage. Secondly, self-disclose often with those you care about. It will build trust and deepen your
                    understanding of one another. </p>
                <p>To recap, In Civil War, Rogers and Stark repeatedly engage in disconfirming communication, which isn’t a
                    good method to proactively find solutions. They were certain they were right, when they could have used
                    provisionalism to listen and be open to each other’s ideas and experiences. Also, Rogers relied too often
                    on exiting to respond to the conflict, which always led to a more intense follow-up discussion or fight
                    later. When Stark chose to self-disclose, they almost came to an agreement, but didn’t because neither
                    could see past their own point of view. Later, Rogers also uses self-disclosure in an attempt to rekindle
                    their relationship, but by that time the damage had been done. Had this self-disclosure come earlier,
                    they wouldn’t have had to beat each other up, though it wouldn’t have been much of a superhero movie
                    without so much conflict now, would it?</p>

                <h4>Leaders in a Nuclear Conflict:</h4>
                <h5>An Analysis of Media Coverage</h5>
                <p>
                    <strong>Introduction</strong>
                </p>
                <p>In this paper, I will analyze how two major news entities, one from North Korea and the other from the U.S.,
                    depict both President Trump and Kim Jong Un as they engage in an ongoing conflict over the possession
                    of nuclear weapons. I have conducted my research by reading dozens of articles, gathering a little over
                    50 I’ve found especially interesting, coding them according to themes, and comparing statements made
                    within these articles to one another. The two news media outlets I have chosen to analyze are the Korean
                    Central News Agency (as translated by KCNA Watch) and Fox News, both of which are prevalent sources for
                    news in their respective areas. After examining articles from both Fox and KCNA, I aim to illustrate
                    a tonal difference between the two news entities, specifically how each media’s portrayal of American
                    and North Korean leadership vastly differs from one another. Both Fox and KCNA are clearly biased in
                    their reporting and portrayal of their country’s leaders, but there is still an evident difference in
                    the type of news each agency produces. KCNA is regulated by a dictator and used as propaganda, which
                    never criticizes their supreme leader and never lends its voice to its people. Fox, despite being (of
                    the major American news sources) the least critical of President Trump, criticizes Kim Jong Un and occasionally
                    Trump, while still maintaining a narrative that will please their right-wing audience. I argue that both
                    Fox and KCNA, though stylistically and structurally different, are both contributing to the ever-rising
                    nuclear tension between America and North Korea by provoking military action. Fox and KCNA put a hefty
                    emphasis on the use of military means to resolve this ongoing conflict, while portraying each other’s
                    leaders as war maniacs.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Issue Overview</strong>
                </p>
                <p>The articles I have examine range from August 8 to November 20, during which many things have happened regarding
                    the nuclear standoff between the U.S. and North Korea. What follows is an overview of the events taking
                    place within the previously specified range, as to give my analysis, which will come later, important
                    context. </p>
                <p>On August 8th, amidst rising nuclear tension, President Trump threatened North Korea while speaking to reporters,
                    promising they “will be met with fire and fury, and frankly power the likes of which this world has never
                    seen before” if they should continue creating nuclear weapons. Hours after Trump made threats of “fire
                    and fury,” North Korea was actively considering launching a missile at Guam. A few days later Trump reiterated.
                    If Kim Jong Un provokes America in any way, “it will be an event the likes of which nobody has seen before
                    – what will happen in North Korea," Trump stated. North Korea hasn’t yet launched a missile at Guam,
                    but the war of words and promises of nuclear devastation proved to be far from over. </p>
                <p>On September 21, Trump issued an executive order, in the form of a sanction, that penalized any country or
                    person who was doing trade with North Korea. Steven Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary, explained, "Foreign
                    financial institutions are now on notice that going forward they can choose to do business with the United
                    States or North Korea, but not both." Though the sanction was placed, it was hardly effective. In fact,
                    China, who does the most trade with North Korea of any country, never confirmed cooperation with the
                    U.S. sanction and never released any comments on the executive order placed by President Trump. On September
                    23, a few days after Trump placed the, as of yet, ineffective sanction, President Trump took to twitter
                    to drive home his point. If North Korea keeps making and testing weapons of mass destruction, “they won't
                    be around much longer!” he wrote. North Korea took Trump’s twitter post as a declaration of war and released
                    a video of them blowing up a U.S. jet as propaganda. </p>
                <p>On November 11, Trump tweets that President Xi of China has agreed to up the sanctions against North Korea.
                    As China does a lot of trade with North Korea, supplying them with almost all of their fuel, their cooperation
                    could make the sanction more effective. However, as of this writing, North Korea has yet to agree to
                    stop making nuclear weapons, rendering the sanctions useless still. Later in November, Trump re-designated
                    North Korea as a “state sponsor of terrorism,” which, among other things, will place even tighter sanctions
                    on North Korea. Days later, on November 28, North Korea launched yet another missile, which according
                    to test results puts the entire U.S. mainland at a greater risk. This, the Hwasong-15, is their most
                    powerful ICBM to date. </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Methodology</strong>
                </p>
                <p>I chose to analyze Fox’s coverage of the nuclear standoff between North Korea and the U.S. because of their
                    known bias toward President Trump. They, according to an article from Politico, are in the business of
                    making money, so they work to please a right-wing audience. </p>
                <p>Analyzing an American news entity that favors Trump’s actions will be interesting because it is more like
                    the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) than any other major American news outlet, who tends to disagree
                    with Trump on almost everything. Both Fox and KCNA have a high regard for their leader while portraying
                    the opposing leader negatively. KCNA is operated by the state itself and acts as an extension of the
                    government. It is often used as a type of propaganda to reinforce Kim Jong Un’s agenda. Even though both
                    news agencies are similar, at least when it comes to supporting their current leader, there are still
                    plenty of differences. </p>
                <p>I will highlight these differences using a few different methods. First, I will code the 25 articles from
                    each news source that I am using as a part of my analysis. I will look for specific themes or words in
                    each article that will support my argument. To make things simple, each statistic will be in the form
                    of a fraction set out of a total of twenty-five. Each source focuses their reports on different themes.
                    As a result, the statistics I present in my analysis will, at times, refer uniquely to its respective
                    news entity. </p>
                <p>For my analysis of Fox, I chose to focus on their use of witnesses who have escaped or otherwise experienced
                    North Korea, to portray Kim Jong Un as a cruel dictator capable of horrible and malicious acts of terror.
                    If the article cited someone who experienced or witnessed life in North Korea, and portrayed Kim Jong
                    Un negatively, then the article was tallied in the overall fraction. Another theme I will use to analyze
                    Fox is their seemingly evident support of Trump’s military threats to North Korea. For this statistic,
                    I tallied all the instances when Fox had reported that Trump or another government leader boasted military
                    strength or threatened to use military action against North Korea. I then set that number above 25. Finally,
                    I compared the content of each tallied article to the opinion pieces of two Fox contributors. By comparing
                    the facts Fox chose to cover with the opinions of Fox contributors, we can get an idea of the narrative
                    Fox aims to create. </p>
                <p>For my analysis of KCNA, I will focus on two aspects of their news. First, how KCNA often blames U.S. nuclear
                    threat, and President Trump himself, as a valid reason to keep building more weapons of mass destruction.
                    I will tally the number of KCNA articles that support this idea of blaming the U.S. and put that number
                    over 25. Additionally, KCNA portrays its own leader by attributing a variety of success and happiness
                    directly to him, which is another theme I will focus on. I will demonstrate this theme by tallying instances
                    of it like I have for previous themes, and analyzing the content of the articles themselves. </p>
                <p>In addition to the themes unique to each source, I have found, coded, and will analyze themes that I are
                    prevalent in both Fox and KCNA’s reporting. These themes include an absence of dissenting viewpoints
                    from those of their leader, as well as a fair amount of insults aimed at the other country’s leader.
                    These themes are found in both agency’s reporting. As a part of my research I have counted the number
                    of articles which contain, or even mention, negative viewpoints about their country’s leader. I have
                    also tallied the number of articles that contain insults directed at the opposing leader. Insults are
                    herein defined as words that are clearly intended to upset the recipient of the insult. Insults are different
                    from threats, which don’t attack the person’s character or appearance directly, but are meant to intimidate
                    the opponent. </p>
                <p>I will reference the statistics I gathered from coding my articles according to theme throughout my analysis.
                    In addition to analyzing each theme using fractions, I will analyze specific passages. To perform this
                    type of analysis, I will cite specific passages from each article, compare them with one another, and
                    make conclusions given the passages’ content. I will cite the articles I used to gather statistics while
                    analyzing their passages, as to avoid an oversaturated and repetitive reference section. </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Analysis</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fox and Kim Jong Un</strong>
                </p>
                <p>I will start my analysis by demonstrating how Fox News portrays Kim Jong Un. Fox’s articles published about
                    him are clearly intended to paint him in a certain light. An example of this includes Fox’s repurposed
                    story from early 2017, which was intended to expose Kim Jong Un as a brutal tyrant. Fox reports that
                    he had meant for the assassination of his half-brother to “horrify the rest of the world.” In another
                    story, Fox refers to Kim’s propaganda as “bizarre” and depict an overly joyous and pleasant Kim Jong
                    Un in a series of photos taken on Kim’s then-recent tour of North Korea. The photos mixed with Fox’s
                    captions work to expose Kim as a ridiculous fraud. Of the 25 articles I used in my analysis, 9 of them
                    refer to Kim Jong Un as being the leader of a rogue regime.</p>
                <p>Fox News uses personal testimonies and witnesses to support their depiction of Kim Jong Un. Out of 25 articles,
                    4 of them focus solely on people who witnesses terrible things in North Korea. For example, Grace Jo,
                    a college student who escaped from North Korea, says somebody “should stop the North Korean regime, because
                    the regime is killing the innocent people in the country. Child, babies and moms are dying without any
                    hope.” Hee Yeon Lim, who also fled from North Korea, states she saw 11 musicians executed brutally. They
                    were tied to the top of anti-aircraft guns before they were “blown to bits” by the guns for allegedly
                    making a “pornographic music video.” Hee Yeon Lim also reports that Kim Jong Un takes “the prettiest”
                    teenage girls out of school and turns them into personal sex slaves. Fox’s use of personal testimony
                    makes their portrayal of Kim Jong Un credible. By giving lending its voice and narrative to others, a
                    believable and cohesive story is created. These testimonies fit into the larger narrative Fox creates
                    by influencing American’s emotions and causing them to hate Kim Jong Un for being so terrible. Those
                    who already hate Kim will hate him more, and those who are advocates for more military action are going
                    to want more military action. </p>
                <p>Another point of analysis is Fox’s use of North Korean media. Fox referenced statements made from North Korean
                    news that promised an “abyss of doom” until “lunatic old” President Trump is out of office, that the
                    U.S. should expect an “unimaginable strike at an unimaginable time” in the form of “gift packages,” and
                    suggesting that “the entire U.S. mainland is within [their] firing range.” The statements Fox pulls from
                    North Korean media are worked into the narrative Fox News has created about Kim Jong Un’s possession
                    and use of nuclear weapons. He is portrayed as reckless, overzealous, and willing to use his weapons
                    to harm the U.S. population. Essentially, Fox, by using North Korea’s own media outlet, deems Kim Jong
                    Un a threat to America, making military action seem more reasonable. </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>KCNA and Trump</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Like Fox News, KCNA also has a variety of tactics they use to portray President Trump in a certain way. KCNA
                    uses strong language to describe Trump, which often manifests itself in the form of insults. KCNA insults
                    President Trump in 9 of the 25 articles. These insults read as facts because they are not presented as
                    subjective quotes from individual sources. For example, KCNA uses insults such as lunatic, war maniac,
                    and old man to describe Trump. Fox also reports when Trump insults Kim Jong Un, but doesn’t state the
                    insults as if they are facts. Trump’s twitter feed, where he personally insults Kim Jong Un, is often
                    used in Fox’s reporting. In fact, 6 articles from Fox contain insults made by Trump. For instance, when
                    Trump dubbed Kim Jong Un as “Little Rocket Man” or when Trump called Kim “short and fat” and a “madman,”
                    Fox reported about it. While Fox doesn’t state that they agree with Trump’s use of name calling, they
                    don’t condone it either. KCNA’s use of insults, however, are clearly intended to provoke Trump and to
                    test his limits, and as previously mentioned are stated as absolutes instead of opinions. </p>
                <p>Not only does KCNA actively insult Trump, but they use his words and actions to justify their possession
                    of nuclear weapons. According to KCNA, Trump has been “running amuck to start a nuclear war.” KCNA evidences
                    this by citing Trump’s remarks of “total destruction” and “annihilation” of North Korea, which they also
                    use as a reason for creating weapons of mass destruction and threatening to use them. KCNA refers to
                    Trump’s visit to Asia as a “war junket.” They report that Trump is spending billions of additional U.S.
                    dollars to enhance American military, which they say is evidence of Trump’s nuclear ambition aimed at
                    “world domination.” KCNA makes subtle comments, some of which I have listed above, about Trump’s plan
                    for world domination and furthers that narrative by making more detailed statements. Specifically, KCNA
                    states that the U.S. will first test their theory of “limited nuclear war” on North Korea, which will
                    unleash nuclear devastation across the country. The U.S. will do this while branding North Korea as a
                    "worldwide threat.” I will point out that, unlike Fox, there articles aren’t well-sourced or evidenced.
                    As a reader, I don’t know how they’ve deduced this notion of “limited nuclear war.” These comments and
                    statements released by KCNA are blaming one person for a nuclear war, should it happen. That person is
                    President Trump. KCNA claims that they are making nuclear weapons “for justice against aggression and
                    tyranny.” They persistently blame President Trump and the American government for forcing them to create
                    these weapons to ward off tyranny and suppression. In fact, an impressive 15 out of KCNA’s 25 articles
                    focus on validating North Korea’s possession of nuclear weapons by blaming the U.S. government and/or
                    Trump. </p>
                <p>KCNA has made it clear that North Korea will never stop making nuclear weapons and are more than willing
                    to use them. This view KCNA expresses of America, which supposedly gives validity to their possessing
                    weapons, is perhaps the most interesting piece of this narrative. North Korea’s insistent on making more
                    weapons, and doesn’t show signs of stopping. They have a cause, according to KCNA, that they are willing
                    to sacrifice everything for. Who knows where they will take it? If one thing is certain, it is that their
                    view on American and their dedication to making weapons of mass destruction has created more tension
                    over the years and it continues to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>KCNA and Kim Jong Un</strong>
                </p>
                <p>KCNA’s portrayal of their own leader is straight forward. He is their “symbol of all victories.” For example,
                    KCNA reports Kim Jong Un’s great satisfaction of recent missile tests and that “the whole country is
                    seized with great joy” as a result. Kim Jong Un has a noble cause to keep created nuclear weapons, according
                    to KCNA. He creates nuclear weapons because “there is a constant danger of nuclear war” from the U.S.
                    and nuclear weapons “preserves peace” for his people. Additionally, KCNA reports that the “great Korean
                    people” live a “happy life,” that they are “steadfast in their faith” of building a historical nuclear
                    force, and that the people of North Korea hold the lives of their supreme leadership “dearer than their
                    own lives.” </p>
                <p>KCNA, out of the 25 articles I analyzed, never presented, or even commented on, views that oppose those of
                    Kim Jong Un. On four occasions KCNA cited outside sources but they were used to their own advantage,
                    two of which came after Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reportedly “fully back[ed]” Trump. KCNA cited
                    the Washington Post and Minjok Ilbo, a South Korean newspaper, when they denounced Abe’s actions in supporting
                    Trump as weak.</p>

                    <strong>
                        Fox and Trump
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>Fox’s portrayal of President Trump is perhaps the most dynamic aspect of the media coverage I am analyzing.
                    They give a portion of their voice and platform to differing opinions about Trump. However, of pieces
                    I gathered, only 3 articles lend their platform to ideas that oppose those of Trump’s. Even when Fox’s
                    stories do contain opposing points of views, they are contained in the form of a controlled narrative
                    or poll. For example, one poll released by Fox states that 70% of Americans think the way President Trump
                    talks about North Korea is not helpful. In another article, Fox reports that Hillary Clinton does not
                    agree with Trump’s actions. They cite her saying his actions are “damaging America’s credibility abroad.”
                    Clinton is also concerned it could provoke a nuclear-arms race in East Asia, according to Fox. While
                    the article in its entirety offers an opposing voice to Trump, it never really commits to making this
                    article about Clinton’s words, and alludes to things that might discredit her opinion. For instance,
                    she brings up Trump’s sexual misconduct later in the article, but Fox can’t help but mention Bill Clinton’s
                    own sexual misconduct, as if that helps Trump’s case when it comes to foreign affairs. </p>
                <p>Fox also reports that the Australian government received a “blistering warning” from North Korea, which was
                    sent to all countries potentially following the U.S. mission to end their nuclear activity. Australian
                    Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull dismissed the letter as a “rant” against Trump. This report offers insight
                    to how other governments view the war of words against Kim Jong Un and Trump. Dismissing the letter,
                    as the Australian Prime Minister did, is evidence that they don’t take Kim Jong Un or Trump seriously,
                    and they are quick to ignore what they view as “rants” from both sides. </p>
                <p>Fox often reports about Trump in a way that favors him and supports his words and actions. Additionally,
                    and most importantly, the facts Fox focus on are typically found in opinion pieces written by Fox’s contributors.
                    For example, Fox covers things such as Trump tweeting “Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with
                    North Korea for 25 years” and they put an emphasis on Trump’s progress with China to place harsher sanctions
                    on North Korea. Alan Dershowits, in an opinion piece for Fox, thinks these actions should be taken. He
                    writes, “we cannot rely on containment and deterrence as acceptable policies to prevent them from using
                    nuclear weapons, as we have done for years with the Soviet Union (and now Russia) and China.” Essentially,
                    his opinion piece supports Trump’s tweet and his placement of new sanctions, which suggest America’s
                    past dealings with North Korea have failed, now something needs to be done about it. This angle makes
                    up a large bulk of Fox’s narrative. </p>
                <p>Additionally, Fox reports on another aspect of Trump’s dealings with North Korea: the use of military action.
                    “I would prefer not going the route of the military, but it’s something, certainly, that could happen,”
                    Trump states in one story. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis agrees with Trump in another Fox article.
                    In it Mattis issues a warning. “Any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military
                    response that is effective and overwhelming,” he states. In others, Trump is boasting about America’s
                    military. In fact, in 9 articles, out of 25, Trump or another advocate for the use of military boasts
                    about America’s military might. This leads me to Harry J. Kazianis’ opinion piece, in which he advocates
                    for sanctions and seemingly supports Trump’s tweets boasting a stronger military that will be used if
                    necessary. He writes: </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “President Trump should make clear that it is the policy of the United States that we will never accept a nuclear North Korea,
                    and that all options still and will always remain on the table.”
                </blockquote>
                <p>Kazianis mentions military force a number of times throughout his opinion piece. Both Dershowits’ and Kazianis’
                    reinforce ideas presented from Fox’s reporting on President Trump as he tries to deal with North Korea.
                    They agree that something needs to be done, what was done in the past isn’t going to work anymore, and
                    that military action should be taken if necessary. They think President Trump should be clear on this
                    issue, and Trump has been clear about using military force if needed. Fox supports Trump on these issues
                    clearly, which shapes a narrative that sets the conflict with North Korea at a dangerously high mark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Over the course of 4 months, Fox and KCNA published dozens of articles covering the possibility of a break-out
                    nuclear war between America and North Korea. An intense coverage of the conflict was heralded in after
                    North Korea fired a missile over the summer, and it continues with North Korea firing another ballistic
                    missile recently, on November 28. The narrative has, in a way, come full circle. At the forefront of
                    this ever-rising conflict stands two public figures: President Trump and Kim Jong Un. After analyzing
                    dozens of articles from Fox News and KCNA, I conclude that President Trump, with his reckless use of
                    nicknames, threats, and frequent calls for worldwide action against North Korea, is making Kim Jong Un
                    eager to test, if not use, more nuclear weapons. However, Kim Jong Un’s unwillingness to stop making
                    these weapons, is also causing more action from Trump in the form of sanctions and possible military
                    action. This is a true show of strength, an arms race that might lead to the destruction of a civilization.
                    To make matters worse, both KCNA and Fox News are loyally supporting their leader’s dangerous decisions
                    by using a variety of tactics to depict the other country’s leader as crazy and their own leader as rational.
