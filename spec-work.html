            <p class="italic-text small-text">I wrote a handful of scripts for my strategic writing courses, three of which are displayed below. One is a public
                service anouncement for the radio that promotes healthy communication between parents and their kids. The
                affiliated website, talkaboutyourfeelings.org, is completely made up. The second script outlines a 30 second
                television promo for the final season of New Girl. At the time of writing the script I knew little about
                the final season, so again, the work is fictional. The third script is what could (but never will) be a television
                advertisement for backcountry.com, a client I chose to write for during one of my classes but otherwise have
                no affliation with. </p>

            <p class="italic-text small-text">I am not a designer, so the advertisements I made for my Writing for Strategic Communication course might lack
                artistic style. However, I focused on writing concise, catchy phrases and engaging body copy to create and
                conceptualize these advertisements, which are displayed below. Note: As part of the curriculum, I chose to
                "work" with backcountry.com but have never actually worked for them.</p>

            <p class="italic-text small-text">I wrote this E-mail during the public relations portion of Writing for Strategic Communication, the same class
                I've mentioned above. </p>

            <p>Dear Jordan,</p>
            <p>How often do you take the beauty of nature for granted? </p>
            <p>We asked ourselves the same question at Backcountry and realized we take it for granted way too often. As a result,
                Backcountry has decided to do more than just enjoy nature when we go camping, hiking or mountain biking.
                We decided to give back, to help maintain its beauty. </p>
            <p>Last year, we gave a portion of what you spent during a limited-time sale to Easy Trees, an organization dedicated
                to connecting people to nature by building parks and planting trees in urban areas. This year, we are a planning
                a service project, and we want you to join us for it. By connecting with us on social media, you’ll be informed
                of the upcoming service opportunities.</p>

            <p class="center">Join us on social media to learn more:</p>
            <ul class="center">
                <li>Twitter - @backcountry</li>
                <li>Instagram - @backcountry</li>
                <li>Facebook - @Backcountry</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The first-ever “Backcountry Gives Back” service project will be held near our headquarters in Park City. If you
                are a resident of Utah and want to volunteer with us, send us an email expressing your intent to volunteer
                along with your phone number. Our email is backcountrygivesback@backcountry.net. As a result, you’ll get
                a free t-shirt and a deeper appreciation for the beauty of nature. We promise! </p>
            <p>In the meantime, keep stocking up on gear at backcountry.com and make time to get outside and do what you love.</p>
            <p>Best,</p>
