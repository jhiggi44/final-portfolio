                        spoken out on local issues as well as matters affecting society on a national or global level. Some
                        student movements have been forgotten, while others have changed the U and the surrounding community.</p>

                        to amend,” passed around petitions demanding that the U reject the document, according to a report
                        by the Daily Utah Chronicle. Hundreds of students signed. Despite the appeal, the new constitution
                        passed.

                    <p>Technology and Venture Commercialization (TVC) has been providing inventors at the University of Utah
                        with the tools and technology they need to turn their inventions into a successful business since
                        1970. To date, TVC has helped create over 230 companies by providing a milestone-driven process to
                        commercialize technologies and inventions created by faculty and students at the U.</p>
                    <p class="truncate">“I like to think of TVC as the bridge between where ideas are created and where they make a difference,”
                        said Jared Pieper, a student, part-time employee at TVC and inventor. “It seems so exciting to hear
                        about the latest research and inventions from academia that will change lives, but in reality it’s
                        not that easy. There is a lot of behind the scenes work to transform an invention into reality and
                        that is the heart of what TVC does.”</p>

                        marched over two miles — from the University of Utah to Westminster College — to protest against
                        Sexual Assault.

                    <p>
                        The event, called “Take Back the Night,” took place Wednesday evening as part of the U’s “Sexual Assault Awareness Month.”
                        The campaign coincides with national Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, proclaimed by
                        President Donald Trump in March.
